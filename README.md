# AKZPlaylistDisplay

AKZPlaylistDisplay is an iOS application that displays a set of playlist from a web service.
It was build with the use of [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) and [Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle).
When the app is launched, immediately fetches from the web service a list of playlist, which then stores them in the device. 
The user can refresh the above list by tapping the refresh button that triggers a request to the web service.
By selecting a playlist the user can see the contents of the specific playlist along with the album covers, artist and tracks playlists.
